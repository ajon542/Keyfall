# LevelGenerator
A scratch pad for a level generator in unity3d

From what I gather, level / dungeon generation is a topic that has been explored in great depths.
I am approaching this project with a clean slate, having not read any papers nor seen too many techniques
in the area of level generation algorithms. This project is an exploration of ideas that I come up with
and a scratch pad to implement them. That being said, there is likely to be a tonne of throw away code
that exists in this project. I could easily search on google and find any paper on the topic and
begin my implementation there, but where is the fun in that?
